# Workflow Generation Examples with Guidelines

This document demonstrates how the comprehensive workflow generation guidelines improve n8n workflow creation.

## Example 1: Water Treatment Monitoring System

### User Request
"Create a workflow to monitor water treatment sensors and take actions based on readings"

### Without Guidelines (OLD)
```
MQTT → Process Sensor → Check pH → Adjust pH Valve → Merge
                    ↘ Check Chlorine → Adjust Chlorine → ↗
                    ↘ Check Temperature → Send Alert → ↗
```
**Problems:**
- All branches merge unnecessarily
- No clear completion points
- Unclear what happens after merge

### With Guidelines (NEW)
```
MQTT → Process Sensor Data → Route by Alert Type (Switch)
         ├─ pH Critical → Adjust pH Valve → Log to Database (END)
         ├─ Chlorine Low → Order Chemical → Send SMS to Manager (END)
         ├─ Temperature High → Send WhatsApp Alert → Create Ticket (END)
         └─ All Normal → Update Dashboard → Archive Data (END)
```
**Improvements:**
- Each branch has a clear purpose and endpoint
- No unnecessary merge
- Actions are complete and meaningful

## Example 2: E-commerce Order Processing

### User Request
"Process incoming orders with inventory check, payment, and shipping"

### Without Guidelines (OLD)
```
Webhook → Check Inventory → Process Payment → Create Shipping → Merge
                         ↘ Send Email → ↗
                         ↘ Update CRM → ↗
```

### With Guidelines (NEW)
```
Webhook → Validate Order → Check Inventory
    ├─ In Stock → Process Payment
    │   ├─ Success → Create Shipping Label → Update Inventory → Send Confirmation Email (END)
    │   └─ Failed → Send Payment Failed Email → Log Failed Order (END)
    └─ Out of Stock → Send Backorder Email → Create Backorder Entry → Notify Warehouse (END)
```

## Example 3: Daily Sales Report

### User Request
"Generate daily sales report combining data from multiple sources"

### Without Guidelines (OLD)
```
Cron → Get Sales Data → Get Inventory → Get Customer Data → Merge → Send Email
```

### With Guidelines (NEW)
```
Cron Daily 9AM → Initialize Report
    ├─ Fetch Sales Data (API)
    ├─ Query Inventory Database
    └─ Get Customer Analytics
         ↓
    Merge All Data (Combine by Position)
         ↓
    Generate Report (Function)
         ↓
    Format as HTML
         ├─ Email to Management
         ├─ Save to Google Drive
         └─ Update Dashboard Widget (END)
```
**Note:** Merge is used appropriately here for data aggregation

## Example 4: Customer Support Ticket Router

### User Request
"Route support tickets based on priority and type"

### Without Guidelines (OLD)
```
Email Trigger → Parse Email → Check Priority → Route → Merge → Log
```

### With Guidelines (NEW)
```
Email Trigger → Parse Ticket Content → Classify Ticket (AI)
    │
    └─ Priority Router (Switch)
        ├─ Critical → Create Urgent Ticket → Notify On-Call Team → Start SLA Timer (END)
        ├─ High → Assign to Senior Support → Send Acknowledgment (END)
        ├─ Normal → Add to Queue → Send Auto-Response (END)
        └─ Low → Create FAQ Response → Send Resolution → Close Ticket (END)
```

## Key Improvements from Guidelines

### 1. Clear Endpoints
- **Before:** Branches merge without purpose
- **After:** Each branch completes its specific task

### 2. Appropriate Merge Usage
- **Before:** Merge everything by default
- **After:** Merge only when combining data

### 3. Meaningful Actions
- **Before:** Generic "process" or "handle" nodes
- **After:** Specific actions like "Create Shipping Label"

### 4. Better Error Handling
- **Before:** No error paths
- **After:** Success/failure branches with appropriate actions

### 5. Logical Flow
- **Before:** Linear thinking
- **After:** Business logic drives the flow

## Guidelines Summary

1. **Every branch must have a clear completion point**
   - Save to database
   - Send notification
   - Update system
   - Create record

2. **Use merge nodes only for data aggregation**
   - Combining reports
   - Aggregating metrics
   - Creating summaries

3. **Name nodes descriptively**
   - ❌ "Process Data"
   - ✅ "Calculate Tax Amount"

4. **Include error handling for critical operations**
   - Payment processing
   - API calls
   - Database operations

5. **Design for the business logic, not the tool**
   - Think about what happens in the real world
   - Model the actual business process
   - Each node should represent a meaningful step
